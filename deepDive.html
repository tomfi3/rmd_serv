<h1>Richmond Air Quality Action Plan Consultation Summary</h1>

<p>This document provides concise summaries of the responses to each survey question, followed by a broad overview of the common themes and sentiments raised.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>1. Other Approach Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reducing Private Car Usage:</strong> Many suggest stricter measures to discourage driving, including banning or levying charges on larger vehicles, expanding low-traffic zones, and strengthening car-free initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Pedestrianisation &amp; Active Travel:</strong> Numerous calls for more pedestrian-friendly streets, cycle lanes with physical barriers, and improved walking routes. Proposals include banning parking on pavements and ensuring pavements remain accessible.</li>
    <li><strong>Wood Burning &amp; Domestic Emissions:</strong> Several highlight the need for tighter regulations on wood-burning stoves, offering education on their environmental impact and pressing for bans or stricter enforcement in built-up areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Enforcement &amp; Monitoring:</strong> Calls for enforcing idling rules, speeding limits, and parking restrictions through fines or public reporting. Some want more air quality monitors in hotspots.</li>
    <li><strong>Addressing Aircraft Pollution:</strong> A subset of responses stress the need to tackle Heathrow flights and flight paths, as well as noise pollution from planes.</li>
    <li><strong>Revisiting Park Closures:</strong> A few respondents suggest re-opening Bushy Park to weekday through-traffic, believing the closure shifts congestion to nearby residential areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous Suggestions:</strong> Incentives for e-bikes, banning leaf blowers, investing in cargo-bike deliveries, and more integrated public transport links.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Other Priorities</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Active Travel &amp; Public Transport Improvements:</strong> Many urge prioritising cycle lanes, dedicated space for walking, and electrification of buses before other measures.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Road Junctions &amp; Congested Routes:</strong> Frequent mention of specific bottlenecks (e.g. Chalkers Corner, Mortlake, Hampton Wick High Street, Barnes High Street). Respondents want these tackled urgently.</li>
    <li><strong>Stricter Speed Limits &amp; Idling Enforcement:</strong> Plenty consider 20mph zones and no-idling enforcement near schools and high streets as immediate priorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Wood Burners &amp; Indoor Air Quality:</strong> Some place high priority on curbing wood-burning stove use in dense residential areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Heathrow &amp; Aircraft Issues:</strong> A notable group insists stronger action on Heathrow and overhead aircraft emissions should be a top priority.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Other Locations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mortlake Level Crossing &amp; Neighbouring Areas:</strong> Repeated mention of vehicle idling along Lower Richmond Road and at Mortlake station crossing.</li>
    <li><strong>Barnes, White Hart Lane, &amp; East Sheen:</strong> Respondents highlight heavy congestion, calling for dedicated monitoring and interventions.</li>
    <li><strong>Hampton, Hampton Hill &amp; Teddington:</strong> Concerns over traffic build-up, air pollution near schools, and poor bus routes. Specific calls to address pinch points on Hampton Hill High Street.</li>
    <li><strong>A316 &amp; Twickenham Corridor:</strong> Identified as an accident-prone ‘race track’ at night and often congested. Some want it reduced to 20mph or reconfigured.</li>
    <li><strong>Richmond Town Centre &amp; Surrounding Roads:</strong> Suggesting partial or full pedestrianisation, or rerouting through-traffic via the A316.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Further Specific Actions for Target Locations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pedestrianisation &amp; Traffic Rerouting:</strong> Calls to close or part-pedestrianise roads (e.g. George Street) and shift cars onto alternative routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Enforce Anti-idling Zones:</strong> Multiple mentions of level crossings, especially Mortlake and Hampton Wick, where targeted monitoring and fines are favoured.</li>
    <li><strong>Cycle Route Upgrades:</strong> Urgent requests for better cycle paths, contraflows on one-way streets, and smoothing dangerous junctions (e.g. Richmond Bridge).</li>
    <li><strong>Re-opening Hammersmith Bridge to Some Traffic:</strong> Opposing views range from full re-opening for cars to only allowing buses or keeping it closed to private vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Additional Transport Measures</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Expand Active Transport &amp; Cycle Infrastructure:</strong> Frequent calls for segregated cycle lanes, more cycle parking (especially covered and free), and improved walking routes.</li>
    <li><strong>More Electric or Zero-Emission Buses:</strong> Many see electrification of public transport as vital to reducing emissions and encouraging modal shifts.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower Speed Limits, Removal of Congestion Points:</strong> Mixed views on 20mph vs. 30mph limits but agreement on minimising gridlock to cut idling.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Bus Routes &amp; Frequency:</strong> Requests for better reliability, more direct links, and priority lanes so buses become the quicker option.</li>
    <li><strong>Restricting SUVs &amp; Large Vehicles:</strong> Some support levies or bans on oversize or highly polluting vehicles, especially for short urban trips.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Additional Groups to Target</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Parents on School Runs:</strong> Many emphasise the large effect of short car journeys at drop-off and pick-up times, advocating school streets and fines for repeat offenders.</li>
    <li><strong>Residents with Disabilities &amp; Elderly:</strong> Calls for careful consideration so these groups are not excluded from new measures. Some fear being cut off by road restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Businesses &amp; Delivery Drivers:</strong> Notable references to idling vans, building contractors, and unsustainable freight patterns needing stricter regulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Those Using Wood Burners &amp; Solid Fuels:</strong> Many want these users more directly targeted through guidance or penalties.</li>
    <li><strong>Commuters, Car Sharers, &amp; Vehicle Idlers:</strong> Repeated pleas for direct engagement, education, and enforcement action where necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Other Areas of Action</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wood Burners, Bonfires, &amp; Domestic Heating:</strong> Strong support for more intervention, whether through outright bans in dense areas or improved enforcement of smoke control rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Large Events &amp; Venues:</strong> Twickenham Stadium and other big attractions require better transport plans and possibly discouraging private cars on event days.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration with Schools &amp; GPs:</strong> Some respondents suggest more data-sharing about health impacts, linking local healthcare providers with the Council’s strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Green Spaces &amp; Tree Planting:</strong> Emphasis on planting trees, shrubbery, and ‘green walls’ near busy routes, with caution about ongoing maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrofit &amp; Housing:</strong> Encouraging sustainable home heating and insulation to lower domestic emissions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Appendix / Additional Evidence Wanted</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>More Localised Air Quality Measurements:</strong> Many want expanded monitoring in hotspots (e.g. near level crossings, busy junctions, schools) and real-time data sharing.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence on Aviation &amp; Wood Smoke Impact:</strong> Some question whether these are underrepresented in official figures. Desire for clarity on aircraft pollution and domestic stoves.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Data &amp; Enforcement Statistics:</strong> Requests for data linking local hospital admissions, GP reports, or penalty notices issued for idling and speed offences.</li>
    <li><strong>Transport Trends &amp; Origin-Destination Studies:</strong> Some want deeper evidence of traffic patterns to ensure solutions do not just shift pollution elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Further Comments</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Frustration &amp; Doubt:</strong> Some are sceptical about the plan’s efficacy, expressing concern about token consultations, poor enforcement, or slow progress on major infrastructure changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong Approval for Active Travel:</strong> A large proportion support more decisive action to expand and improve cycling, walking, and public transport facilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Concerns about Displacement:</strong> Worries that removing traffic from one area simply pushes congestion elsewhere, increasing pollution in less affluent or more vulnerable neighbourhoods.</li>
    <li><strong>Fairness for Disabled &amp; Elderly:</strong> Multiple respondents caution the plan should not penalise those who rely on cars for essential journeys.</li>
    <li><strong>Calls for Greater Ambition:</strong> Several want bolder targets, faster adoption of major changes, and stronger partnerships with national and regional bodies.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Overall Sentiment and Common Themes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strong Support for Reduced Car Use &amp; Better Active Travel:</strong> Many desire more pedestrian areas, safe cycling routes, and reliable zero-emission buses. A large number see private cars, especially SUVs, as the main culprit in urban congestion and pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Concerns about Wood Burning &amp; Aircraft Emissions:</strong> Wood burners remain a persistent theme, with some calling for outright bans. Others raise Heathrow’s major share of NOx and question how the Council can influence flight path emissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Emphasis on Enforcement &amp; Practical Action:</strong> There is frustration that existing measures (no-idling zones, 20mph limits) are not properly enforced. Respondents want robust policing of traffic offences, including idling, speeding, and illegal parking.</li>
    <li><strong>Desire for Better Communication &amp; Evidence:</strong> Many request detailed local data, monitoring, and proof of improvement. There is a call for clear targets and deadlines for reducing pollution in specific areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Inclusivity &amp; Support for Vulnerable Groups:</strong> Multiple responses highlight disabled and elderly residents, urging the Council to avoid leaving them isolated. Others note children’s health, especially around schools.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed Views on Specific Approaches:</strong> There is a clash between those wanting major road closures or further park restrictions and those who see closures or lower speed limits as creating worse congestion and displacing pollution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, respondents share a desire to improve air quality but differ on the best means of achieving it. A large portion favour strong active travel measures, tree planting, and bolder steps to reduce traffic and domestic emissions. Others worry about the economic impact, inclusivity for those less able to switch to walking or cycling, and the displacement of pollution to other areas.</p>
