    <li><strong>20mph vs. 30mph Debate:</strong> Mixed views; some want universal 20mph for safety and cleaner air, others believe 20mph can increase congestion and pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Park Re-openings &amp; Traffic Rerouting:</strong> Divided opinions on Bushy Park and other closures, with some asserting displacement of traffic to residential roads.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 2. Other Priorities -->
<h2>2. Are there any aspects of the plan you think should be prioritised?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>School Streets &amp; Idling:</strong> Many insist reducing car presence around schools should be paramount, citing children’s heightened vulnerability.</li>
    <li><strong>Active Travel &amp; Safe Cycling:</strong> Strong appetite for prioritising fully protected bike lanes, pedestrian routes, and reduced car space in town centres.</li>
    <li><strong>Strict Enforcement:</strong> Respondents urge no-idling penalties and consistent crackdowns on speeding, engine revving, and illegal parking.</li>
    <li><strong>Wood-Burning Enforcement:</strong> Repeated pressure to target wood burners, with some wanting immediate bans or rigorous oversight.</li>
    <li><strong>Bus Electrification:</strong> Calls to accelerate conversion to electric or zero-emission buses, particularly on busy or congested routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Major Junctions &amp; Hotspots:</strong> Many mention Mortlake rail crossing, Hampton Wick High Street, Chalkers Corner, and Barnes High Street as areas needing urgent action.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 3. Additional Locations -->
<h2>3. If there are any additional locations you would suggest, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mortlake, White Hart Lane, &amp; Barnes:</strong> High congestion and idling near level crossings. Fears of rising pollution as local developments progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Hampton &amp; Hampton Hill:</strong> Gridlock around the High Street and pinch points leading to worsening air quality. Requests for expanded bus routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Teddington &amp; Twickenham Corridors:</strong> Busy roads (A316, London Road) cause concern, particularly at peak times. Some want 20mph or improved cycle paths.</li>
    <li><strong>Richmond Town Centre &amp; Bridge Approaches:</strong> Frequent suggestions to pedestrianise or restrict through-traffic to cut queues and idle engines.</li>
    <li><strong>Areas Under Flight Paths:</strong> Recurring mention of aircraft noise and emissions over large swathes of the borough.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 4. Further Specific Actions for Target Locations -->
<h2>4. If there are any other actions you suggest specific to a target location, please tell us below.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pinch-Point Remodelling:</strong> Redesign busy junctions (e.g., Hampton, Mortlake crossing) to reduce queues and encourage smoother traffic flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Pedestrianising Streets:</strong> Multiple calls to close sections of Barnes, Richmond, or Twickenham town centres to private cars, especially on weekends or permanently.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Signage &amp; Idling Fines:</strong> Targeting schools, stations, and level crossings with visible anti-idling notices and robust enforcement measures.</li>
    <li><strong>“Green Walls” &amp; Urban Planting:</strong> Proposals to plant more hedges, trees, and living walls near traffic hotspots to help filter pollutants.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed Views on Park Access:</strong> Some want roads in Bushy Park reopened on weekdays to spread traffic, others wish to keep them closed to preserve air quality there.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 5. Additional Transport Measures -->
<h2>5. If there are any additional transport measures you wish to propose, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Better Cycling Infrastructure:</strong> Numerous demands for continuous, protected cycle lanes, safe parking (covered and free), and e-bike charging points.</li>
    <li><strong>Radical Car-Free Initiatives:</strong> Ideas such as car-free days, bans on non-resident traffic, and last-mile walking or cycling for school runs.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrifying Public Transport:</strong> Some advocate trams or new rail routes; many want quicker bus electrification plus more frequent, reliable bus services.</li>
    <li><strong>Disincentivising Car Ownership:</strong> Proposals to raise parking permit costs (especially for second cars, large SUVs), reduce on-street parking space, and shift road capacity to cyclists or pedestrians.</li>
    <li><strong>Scepticism about EVs:</strong> While many want expanded EV charging, others note heavier EVs generate more PM from tyres and brakes.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 6. Additional Groups to Target -->
<h2>6. If there are any additional groups you think should be targeted, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>School-Run Parents:</strong> Regarded as key contributors to congestion and idling, especially during drop-off and pick-up times.</li>
    <li><strong>Older &amp; Disabled Residents:</strong> Concerns that heavy restrictions may isolate those reliant on cars. Some call for better inclusive transport solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery Drivers &amp; Contractors:</strong> Vans idling on kerbs, online deliveries causing repeated short trips. Calls for more enforcement or cargo-bike incentives.</li>
    <li><strong>Wood-Burner Users:</strong> Seen as a group needing particular outreach and/or sanctions to reduce particulate pollution.</li>

<div class="summary">
    <h2>Holistic Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, there is strong consensus that air quality is a high-priority issue which demands 
        meaningful actions and enforcement. Yet respondents diverge on how aggressive the measures 
        should be and how to balance differing needs. Many advocate radical traffic reduction, 
        mass pedestrianisation, and outright bans on wood-burners, while others caution that 
        “anti-car” policies can penalise older or disabled people and shift pollution onto 
        surrounding roads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common proposals include robust expansions of cycling infrastructure, more stringent 
        controls on idling vehicles (especially near schools and level crossings), and direct 
        lobbying to curb aircraft emissions from Heathrow. Wood-burning stoves repeatedly come 
        under fire as a major local pollutant needing firm regulation. At the same time, there 
        are persistent calls for better data, clearer targets, and credible enforcement — 
        particularly for no-idling rules, speeding, and parking infractions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, the community appears supportive of reducing pollution in principle, 
        but has strong opinions on the best ways forward. Recurrent themes include a need 
        for more detailed planning, full transparency over data, faster bus electrification, 
        and real investment in alternatives (such as e-bike infrastructure) to ensure 
        driving remains an option of last resort rather than the default.
