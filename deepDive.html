<h1>Analysis of Survey Responses</h1>

<!-- 1. Other Approach Suggestions -->
<h2>1. Are there any other approaches you would like to suggest?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Calls for more radical measures such as pedestrianisation, banning private cars from certain areas, and restricting SUVs.</li>
    <li>Frequent suggestions to ban or heavily regulate wood-burning stoves and open fires (highlighting particulate pollution).</li>
    <li>Encouragement of truly segregated cycle lanes (not shared pavements) to build safe, continuous networks.</li>
    <li>Strong requests for stricter measures on idling (e.g., higher fines, more active enforcement, or community-led reporting).</li>
    <li>Greater emphasis on education, awareness campaigns, and direct engagement with residents to change behaviors around car use.</li>
    <li>Suggestions to address aircraft pollution (Heathrow overflights) and to lobby for changes outside direct Council control.</li>
    <li>Calls to re-examine speed limits (20 mph vs. 30 mph) and traffic rerouting so as not to simply shift congestion.</li>
    <li>Proposals to expand community involvement, such as “citizen science” for air quality monitoring and volunteer enforcement.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 2. Other Priorities -->
<h2>2. Are there any aspects of the plan you think should be prioritised?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Strong theme around prioritising active travel (cycling and walking infrastructure) and reducing car dependency.</li>
    <li>Frequent calls to prioritise school areas (“school streets”), especially to reduce idling at pick-up/drop-off times.</li>
    <li>Increasing enforcement, e.g., no-idling enforcement, speed-limit enforcement, and controlling wood burners.</li>
    <li>Some respondents favor tackling major roads and junctions where congestion is frequent—e.g., Mortlake, Chalkers Corner, A316.</li>
    <li>Calls to “go faster” on bus electrification and greener public transport options.</li>
    <li>Mixed feedback on speed-limit policy: some argue 20 mph is too slow, others want borough-wide 20 mph for improved air quality.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 3. Additional Locations -->
<h2>3. If there are any additional locations you would suggest, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Many specific mentions: Sandycombe Road (Kew), Barnes High Street & White Hart Lane, Mortlake rail crossing, Teddington, Twickenham, Hampton Wick, and A316 corridors.</li>
    <li>Requests to consider “less obvious” areas, e.g., Hampton and Hanworth, not just the central hotspots.</li>
    <li>Concerns about traffic displacement to surrounding roads (e.g., when park roads are closed) and increased congestion in adjacent residential streets.</li>
    <li>Calls for improved cycle lanes and bus routes on key arteries and bridges (Richmond Bridge, Hammersmith Bridge closure). Many want new or reopened infrastructure to relieve local bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Frequent mention of Heathrow, flight-path noise and emissions over various wards in the borough.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 4. Further Specific Actions for Target Locations -->
<h2>4. If there are any other actions you suggest specific to a target location, please tell us below.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Repeated calls for better signage and strict enforcement against idling near level crossings (Mortlake, White Hart Lane) and near schools.</li>
    <li>Suggestions to reopen or partially reopen roads/parks (Bushy Park, Richmond Park) on weekdays to avoid idling backups in densely populated areas.</li>
    <li>Some want more ambitious changes, e.g., fully car-free areas along Barnes riverside or Richmond Town Centre.</li>
    <li>Suggestions to create “greening” buffers near busy roads (tree planting, green walls) to reduce exposure to pollutants in heavily trafficked corridors.</li>
    <li>Various calls to address “pinch points” where poor road layouts or traffic lights cause heavy congestion and queuing.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 5. Additional Transport Measures -->
<h2>5. If there are any additional transport measures you wish to propose, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Strong push for truly safe and connected cycle infrastructure, from segregated lanes to increased cycle parking with coverage and e-bike charging.</li>
    <li>Support for more radical “car-free days,” “car-free zones,” or mandatory “last-mile walking” near schools.</li>
    <li>Electrification of bus fleets and expansion of bus routes; some suggest trams or new rail options to replace car travel.</li>
    <li>Calls for higher parking fees, or fewer parking spaces for large vehicles, to discourage car use and free space for wider pavements and bike lanes.</li>
    <li>Mixed opinions on EVs: some want easier EV charging and reduced EV permit fees; others emphasize that EVs are heavy, produce PM2.5 from tyres/brakes, and are not the sole solution.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 6. Additional Groups to Target -->
<h2>6. If there are any additional groups you think should be targeted, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Families with children (especially school-run drivers) frequently cited as an impactful group to focus on.</li>
    <li>Older adults and disabled residents who rely on cars must be considered more carefully: concerns that proposals are “anti-car” and risk isolating vulnerable people.</li>
    <li>Wood-burner owners and certain “polluting” vehicle owners, especially those with large SUVs or diesel engines.</li>
    <li>Delivery drivers, online shopping couriers, tradespeople—people who often idle or drive frequently through the borough.</li>
    <li>Young adults and parents, so that cultural norms around walking/cycling become embedded earlier.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 7. Other Areas of Action -->
<h2>7. If you have any other suggestions for areas of action, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft pollution at Heathrow is a recurring theme—residents want more lobbying and data around flight-path noise and emissions.</li>
    <li>Wood burning stoves: repeated emphasis on taking more proactive steps (bans, stricter enforcement, building regulations). Many feel strongly about this.</li>
    <li>Addressing the potential impact of major construction or utility works (e.g., Thames Water projects) that could bring heavy machinery and more traffic.</li>
    <li>Some feel that the council must address broader climate or sustainability issues (e.g., circular economy, local business sponsorship, plastic waste). Others insist the plan is too broad or “woke.”</li>
    <li>Noise pollution—from planes, e-bikes/scooters, leaf blowers, etc.—cited as a neglected aspect of the plan.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 8. Additional Evidence Desired -->
<h2>8. If there is any additional evidence you would like to see, please tell us here.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Better air-quality data coverage throughout the entire borough, not just “hotspot” locations. Many request more monitors in local streets.</li>
    <li>More transparency on how data links pollution to health outcomes. Some want detailed local-level data for themselves (e.g., real-time or citizen science input).</li>
    <li>Evidence about the relative impact of different pollution sources (e.g., cars vs. aircraft vs. wood burners vs. industry).</li>
    <li>Some question the legitimacy of current data, wanting clarity to avoid “emotional” or “ideological” decisions.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 9. Further Comments -->
<h2>9. Please use this space for any further comments about the Richmond Air Quality Action Plan.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Divide between those who feel the plan “does not go far enough” versus those who feel it is too “anti-car” and needs a more balanced approach.</li>
    <li>Criticism that the plan lacks concrete, measurable targets (e.g., how many km of new cycle lanes by when?).</li>
    <li>Worries about implementation and enforcement: many say “the council must back up words with real action.”</li>
    <li>Some positive remarks praising the Council’s efforts but expressing doubts about real follow-through.</li>
    <li>Concerns about the ability of older, disabled, or less affluent residents to meet new requirements (whether EV, bikes, etc.).</li>
    <li>Multiple references to frustration with how previous consultations or measures were enacted, a perceived lack of transparency, or “survey fatigue.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="summary">
    <h2>Holistic Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Overall sentiment is divided. A large proportion of respondents demand more radical and urgent action, 
        calling for measures such as pedestrianising town centres, banning or severely restricting large vehicles 
        and wood-burning stoves, and creating widespread segregated cycle routes. They feel current proposals do 
        not go “far enough” or “fast enough.” Meanwhile, a significant minority warn against “anti-car” rhetoric 
        and stress that drivers (especially older or disabled) and businesses still need practical transport 
        options. Some question the data’s validity or worry about unintended consequences of road closures and 
        speed limits shifting traffic elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many respondents highlight:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wood-burning stoves and idling:</strong> Called out repeatedly as major polluters needing more proactive enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement challenges:</strong> Common feeling that signage alone is inadequate and must be backed by penalties.</li>
        <li><strong>Aircraft pollution:</strong> Strong calls to include or lobby more vigorously on Heathrow traffic and noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Active travel infrastructure:</strong> Widespread support for segregated cycle lanes, safe walking routes, and better connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Parking and traffic flow:</strong> Some want high charges or reduced parking to discourage cars; others want improved road layouts 
            and 30 mph limits on main roads to keep traffic flowing and reduce congestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Social equity considerations:</strong> Repeated reminders not to disadvantage elderly, disabled, low-income, or non-cyclists 
            who may rely on cars or existing public transport.</li>
        <li><strong>Calls for more data and transparency:</strong> Many want better local air-quality monitoring, especially near schools and 
            congested roads, and stronger evidence connecting pollution sources to health impacts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In summary, respondents share a desire to improve air quality but differ on how bold or restrictive measures 
        should be, how to manage conflicting needs (e.g., drivers vs. active travel), and how to ensure enforcement 
        is effective and fair.
