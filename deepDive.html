    <h2>Holistic Summary</h2>
    <p>The survey responses reflect a community deeply concerned about air quality and supportive of initiatives to improve it. Common themes include a strong desire to reduce car usage, promote active travel through better cycling and walking infrastructure, and enforce measures against idling vehicles. Many respondents advocate for more ambitious and immediate action, emphasizing that current plans may not go far enough to address pressing issues.</p>

    <p>There is a significant call to address pollution sources beyond road traffic, notably wood-burning stoves and aircraft emissions. Respondents highlight the need for holistic planning to ensure that actions in one area do not adversely affect another. The importance of considering the needs of vulnerable groups, such as the disabled and elderly, is also emphasized to prevent social exclusion.</p>

    <p>Concerns about the effectiveness and enforcement of proposed measures are prevalent, with some skepticism about whether the plans will lead to tangible improvements. Many suggest that policies should be evidence-based, with transparent reporting and community involvement to build trust and ensure accountability.</p>

    <p>Overall, the community appears eager to support and participate in efforts to improve air quality but seeks more decisive action, better communication, and consideration of broader impacts to ensure the success of the Richmond Air Quality Action Plan.</p>
